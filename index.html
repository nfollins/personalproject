The Art of Flawlessness – " I personally believe that the signature of
a great makeup artist is not to mask your subject's features with too
much makeup. It's about blending to perfection, hiding imperfections 
and making her glow” ----Britney
<br><br>

Makeup Artists in the NYC area and beyond. The company was created by
